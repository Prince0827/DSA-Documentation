# DSA- Project Documentation 
In my Tech Learning Journey at The Incubator Hub (DSA),  I started building
my portfolio from the inception of my DATA ANALYSIS course, through 
archiving all the videos of tutorials, keeping class notes,and personal
practice.
 I have also learnt a couple of skills, such as Excel V/Xlookup, Nesting, Concatenation, and numerous functions and shortcuts. The clincher for me is the deepening of my knowledge of the Power Query Editor and Power Pivot to extract, perform data wrangling, and join two tables to create pivot tables 
for Analysis and presentation.
