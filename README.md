# DSA-Documentation 

 My Tech Learning Journey at The Incubator Hub,  I started building my portfolio from  the inception of my DATA ANALYSIS class.
 
 I have also learnt a couple of skills, such as the usage of Excel tools such as Power Query Editor,to extract, perform data wrangling, and Pivot tables for Analysis and 
 
 reporting. Also, Power BI for business Intelligence, and portfolio building 

## Project Topic : DSA Data Analysis Project

### Data Cleaning and Preparation 

At the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following action

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the exploration of the available data  to answer some questions about the prepared 
data such as 
- What is the overall sales record

### Data Analysis 

This where we include some basic line of code or queries or even some of the DAX expressions ued during your analysis
